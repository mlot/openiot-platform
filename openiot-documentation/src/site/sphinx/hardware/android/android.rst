 OpenIoT Android Integration Libraries
=========================================
OpenIoT supports rich integration with Google's `Android <http://www.android.com/>`_ platform
including full round-trip device interactions over MQTT. The OpenIoT Android libraries
include a sample wizard for setting up connectivity by establishing a remote OpenIoT server
and MQTT broker to use.

------------------------------------------
 Locating the OpenIoT Android Libraries
------------------------------------------
The OpenIoT Android libraries are available on GitHub and have been released under the
following path:

	https://github.com/reveal-technologies/openiot-android
	
Android in OpenIoT is divided into three separate projects:

	:OpenIoTFrameworkLibrary:
		Library with base framework code for creating a OpenIoT Android application. It contains
		the base interfaces and implementations that provide an abstracted view of OpenIoT
		interactions.
	:OpenIoTMQTTLibrary:
		Library with code specific to communicating with OpenIoT over MQTT. It uses the
		`Fuse MQTT Client <http://mqtt-client.fusesource.org/>`_ as a means to interact with
		an MQTT broker, sending and receiving OpenIoT messages. It also contains the base
		connectivity wizard which provides an interface for configuring the remote OpenIoT
		host and MQTT broker information.
	:OpenIoTExample:
		An Android application project that uses the other two library projects to create a 
		sample application that sends sensor data to OpenIoT. It provides an example of
		using the other libraries to create an application with a connectivity setup wizard,
		dynamic device registration, and event reporting based on real-time sensor readings.

.. warning:: Make sure that you are using a version of the libraries that is compatible with your 
			OpenIoT instance. The *master* branch always contains the latest stable code, but
			there is a branch in the repository for each corresponding OpenIoT release.
            		
------------------------------------------------------
 Getting Started with a New OpenIoT Android Project
------------------------------------------------------
If you have not already done so, download and install the 
`Android ADT Bundle <http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/bundle.html>`_ which includes
the Android Eclipse development environment and SDK. The Android documentation includes detailed
instructions on getting your development environment installed and configured for developing
applications.

Create Project Using New Project Wizard
---------------------------------------
Once the development environment is installed, a new project should be created for your
OpenIoT Android application. Click **File > New > Android Application Project** to open
the **New Android Application** wizard as shown below:

.. image:: /_static/images/hardware/android/new-application.png
   :width: 100%
   :alt: New Android Application Wizard
   :align: left

Enter a project name and package name for your application, then choose the other settings as appropriate
for your application and click **Next**.

.. warning:: The minimum required SDK for OpenIoT Android libraries is **API 11: Android 3.0 (Honeycomb)**.
			The intent is to release future versions to support compatibility with older runtimes when time
			allows.
			
On the next page of the wizard, uncheck the **Create custom launcher icon** and **Create activity** checkboxes.

.. image:: /_static/images/hardware/android/new-application-2.png
   :width: 100%
   :alt: New Android Application Wizard
   :align: left

Click **Finish** to create the new application. The Eclipse workspace should show the **Java** perspective 
with the newly created project displayed in the **Package Explorer** pane. You may have to close the 
welcome screen or manually change over to the **Java** perspective. The screen should look like the one
below:

.. image:: /_static/images/hardware/android/new-application-3.png
   :width: 100%
   :alt: New Android Project
   :align: left

Import OpenIoT Libraries from GitHub
--------------------------------------
The OpenIoT GitHub repositiory includes `library projects <http://developer.android.com/tools/projects/index.html#LibraryProjects>`_
that provide a framework for building Android applications. By importing the projects into your application, the
majority of the interactions with OpenIoT are taken care of so you can focus on the core application code.
To import the OpenIoT Android library projects:

1) Click **Import > Git > Projects from Git**. Click **Next**.
2) In the *Select Repository Source* panel, choose **Clone URI**. Click **Next**. 
3) In the *Source Git Respository* panel, enter the following URL: 

	 https://github.com/reveal-technologies/openiot-android

   The user interface should automatically fill in the other fields based on the URL as shown below:

   .. image:: /_static/images/hardware/android/import-from-git.png
     :width: 100%
     :alt: Choose Git Respository


4) Click **Next** to continue and choose which branches you want to check out. The best choice 
   is the branch that is the exact match for the OpenIoT instance it will be
   communicating with. Higher numbered branches should be backward compatible with 
   older OpenIoT servers.
5) Click **Next** to move to the next step in the wizard, the **Local Destination** panel.
   You can usually leave the destination values as the defaults unless you have a different location you would 
   rather store the imported repository. 
6) Click **Next** to move to the next step in the wizard, where you will
   choose how to import the Eclipse projects contained in the repository. 
7) Choose **Import existing projects**, using the default **Working Directory** (which should be the 
   location specified in the **Local Destination** panel).
8) Click **Next** to move to the **Import Projects** panel.
9) Choose to import the projects that end with **Library** as shown below:

   .. image:: /_static/images/hardware/android/import-projects.png
       :width: 100%
       :alt: Import Projects


10) Click **Finish** to import the projects into your local Eclipse workspace.

Reference OpenIoT Libraries from New Project
----------------------------------------------
In order to use the OpenIoT Android libraries, your new project must include the libraries on its classpath.
Open the properties for the project you created earlier in **Package Explorer** and choose **Android**
in the list of sections on the left. At the bottom of the panel in the **Library** group, 
click the **Add...** button to add references to the OpenIoT libraries as shown below:

.. image:: /_static/images/hardware/android/reference-projects.png
   :width: 50%
   :alt: Add Project References
   :align: center

Click **OK** to apply the changes and your resulting workspace should look something like the image below. Note
that if you open the **project.properties** file, there are now references to the OpenIoT libraries.

.. image:: /_static/images/hardware/android/after-reference-projects.png

   :alt: After Adding References
   :align: left

With the projects added, the OpenIoT Android framework elements may be used in your project.


------------------------------------
 Introduction to Framework Concepts
------------------------------------
When the Android application starts, a main activity is launched to present an interface to the user. 
The OpenIoT libraries provide classes that extend the base Android
`Activity <http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html>`_ class and 
allow you to inherit many of the core interactions that a connected
device needs to communicate with OpenIoT.

Currently, there are two base classes that provide different levels of functionality:

`OpenIoTActivity <../../android/framework/apidocs/com/openiot/android/OpenIoTActivity.html>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Contains the base logic for connecting to an underlying message service (defaulting to MQTT) in order to send events to
	and receive commands from OpenIoT. This class only deals in sending binary data between the application
	and OpenIoT, so it will not work out-of-the-box since OpenIoT defaults to using messages encoded with
	Google Protocol Buffers. This base class is useful for implementing custom protocols between an Android
	application and OpenIoT.

`OpenIoTProtobufActivity <../../android/framework/apidocs/com/openiot/android/protobuf/OpenIoTProtobufActivity.html>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Extends functionality from OpenIoTActivity to include support for encoding/decoding messages using the standard
	OpenIoT `proto <https://github.com/reveal-technologies/openiot/blob/master/openiot-protobuf/proto/openiot.proto>`_
	file. This base class offers methods that wrap common OpenIoT actions such as sending events to the server
	and receiving commands from the server. It also has basic support for round-trip self registration. Most 
	applications will use this base class unless they need to implement their own encoding scheme for messages.

Note that, rather than directly referencing protocol specifics in the base activities, the framework instead
defers to talking to a `Service <http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service.html>`_ via 
interfaces. This adds a level of indirection that allows the messaging layer to be swapped without affecting
the application code. The default service implementation is:

`MqttService <../android/mqtt/apidocs/com/openiot/android/mqtt/MqttService.html>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Provides connectivity to OpenIoT via an MQTT broker by using the
	`Fuse MQTT Client <http://mqtt-client.fusesource.org/>`_ over a TCP/IP connection. 
	Connectivity parameters for the MqttService are provided by a configuration object that
	is passed to the `Intent <http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html>`_
	used to start the service. The OpenIoT example application detects whether the configuration
	has been set and, in cases where it is missing, displays a connectivity wizard to set and verify the 
	values. The service automatically handles reconnecting if the network becomes inaccessible and provides
	hooks for notifying the parent application when OpenIoT connectivity changes. It is important to note that,
	since the MQTT functionality is running as a service, the connection to OpenIoT remains in place even when
	the application that started it is not running. The periodic "keep-alive" ping messages sent from client to
	MQTT broker have been configured to be sent infrequently to allow the network hardware on the device to 
	conserve power.

.. warning:: The MQTT library requires network access, so make sure to add the necessary permissions. The
	Android manifest shown later in the document provides an example of doing this.

--------------------------
 Building the Application
--------------------------
Building a OpenIoT application is straightforward since most of the low-level details are taken
care of by the framework. Start by creating a base Java package for the code by clicking 
the *src* folder and choosing **New > Package** from the menu. The package name should be the same as the
one specified when creating the project.

Create a Main Activity
----------------------

Next, create the main activity that will be displayed when the application starts. For this example, the activity
will extend OpenIoTProtobufActivity so that it works with the default OpenIoT configuration.

.. image:: /_static/images/hardware/android/new-activity-wizard.png
   :width: 100%
   :alt: Create Main Activity
   :align: left

Add Code for Connecting to OpenIoT
------------------------------------
Once the activity has been created, very little code is required to get a basic application up and running.
The code below illustrates a simple activity that connects to OpenIoT over MQTT and registers the device
for sending events and receiving commands. Note that most of the heavy lifting is taken care of by the framework.

.. literalinclude:: ExampleActivity.java
   :language: java

.. warning:: You will need to update the MQTT broker location (set in the **onCreate()** method) to point to
	a publicly available OpenIoT MQTT broker. The easiest method for this is to start up a OpenIoT
	instance on Amazon EC2 and use the public IP address for the instance as the MQTT broker hostname.

Add Declarations in Android Manifest
------------------------------------
To create an application that can be built and executed on a device, a few more artifacts need to be added. The
standard **AndroidManifest.xml** needs to be edited to include the new activity and reference the MQTT service
provided by the framework.

.. literalinclude:: AndroidManifest.xml
   :language: xml

Add Files for Layout and Internationalization
---------------------------------------------
In the **res/layout** folder, add a file named **main.xml** with the following content. It provides the layout
for the main screen shown in the application.

.. literalinclude:: main.xml
   :language: xml

In the **res/values** folder, edit the file named **strings.xml** and replace it with the following content.

.. literalinclude:: strings.xml
   :language: xml

Run the Application
-------------------
Now that all of the pieces are in place for a basic application, the next step is to execute the code.
ADT allows you to execute applications in an emulator or directly on a device. Their developer guide to 
`building in Eclipse <http://developer.android.com/tools/building/building-eclipse.html>`_ gives details
on both methods. If you debug the application on a device, you will see output similar to below:

.. image:: /_static/images/hardware/android/debug-application.png
   :width: 100%
   :alt: Debug Application on a Device
   :align: left

Once the application is running on the device, you can swap to the **DDMS** perspective to view a realtime 
log of what is happening on the device. Looking at the messages for the OpenIoT example application
shows detailed information about the application connecting to and communicating with the MQTT broker.
An example of what you might see is shown below:

.. image:: /_static/images/hardware/android/ddms-perspective.png
   :width: 100%
   :alt: Eclipse DDMS Perspective
   :align: left

-------------------------------
 Automatic Device Registration
-------------------------------
One of the key actions taken in the example code is the call to **registerDevice()**:

.. code-block:: java
   :emphasize-lines: 4

	protected void onConnectedToOpenIoT() {
		Log.d(TAG, "Connected to OpenIoT.");
		try {
			registerDevice(getUniqueDeviceId(), "d2604433-e4eb-419b-97c7-88efe9b2cd41", null);
		} catch (OpenIoTMessagingException e) {
			Log.e(TAG, "Unable to send device registration.", e);
		}
	}

This code generates a registration message to OpenIoT via MQTT which informs OpenIoT that a
device wants to register (or verify registration) with the system. The two key pieces of information
passed in the call are the unique device id (in this case the one discovered from the phone itself) 
and the token for the device specification (which tells OpenIoT what type of hardware it is talking to).
OpenIoT checks whether there is a device with the given hardware id and, if not, creates one
dynamically. When creating the device, it also creates an unassociated assignment which allows the 
device to start receiving events without needing to be associated with an asset. Sitewhere responds to
the device registration request with a registration ack which is sent back to the device. The code
that processes the ack is shown below:

.. code-block:: java

	public void handleRegistrationAck(Header header, RegistrationAck ack) {
		switch (ack.getState()) {
		case ALREADY_REGISTERED: {
			Log.d(TAG, "Device was already registered.");
			break;
		}
		case NEW_REGISTRATION: {
			Log.d(TAG, "Device was registered successfully.");
			break;
		}
		case REGISTRATION_ERROR: {
			Log.d(TAG,
					"Error registering device. " + ack.getErrorType().name() + ": " + ack.getErrorMessage());
			break;
		}
		}
	}

The acknowledgement returns information about whether a new device was registered, there was an existing device
for the hardware id, or there was an error in registration. The device can then act accordingly. 
On the OpenIoT side of things, the new device shows up in the list of device assignments once
registration has completed:

.. warning:: Before sending events to OpenIoT, it is important that registration has completed.
	Otherwise, the events will be discarded since they do not reference a valid device.

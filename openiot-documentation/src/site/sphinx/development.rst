OpenIoT Developer Guide
=========================
This manual covers the steps necessary for a developer to get started working with the 
OpenIoT source code. It addresses topics such as setting up a development environment,
downloading OpenIoT source code, and building OpenIoT artifacts.

-------------------------------------
Setting Up a Developement Environment
-------------------------------------
Most of the core OpenIoT source code is written in `Java <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html>`_
and made available on on the OpenIoT `GitHub page <https://github.com/openiot>`_. The easiest
path to get up and running is to use a development environment that has integrated support for the Git version 
control system. This guide assumes that you will be using the Eclipse IDE. OpenIoT was developed with Eclipse
and the repositories contain artifacts that make it simple to load the source into Eclipse.

Download Eclipse
----------------
First, you will need to download and install a version of Eclipse that supports Java development. Open the 
following link and choose a version for your platform.

	http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/junosr2
	
Follow the installation instructions for Eclipse and start the IDE.

Install eGit Plugin
-------------------
Once Eclipse is installed, you will need to install a plugin to allow it to interact with the OpenIoT Git
repository. The following steps will guide you though locating and installing the plugin.

1. In the Eclipse menu, choose **Help > Install New Software...**.
2. In the **Work with:** dropdown, choose **Juno** to view the plugins available.
3. Open the **Collaboration** category and choose **Eclipse EGit** and **Eclipse EGit Mylyn GitHub Feature**.
4. Continue clicking **Next** and accept the license agreement, then click **Finish**.
5. Restart Eclipse when prompted to complete the installation.
6. Click **Window > Preferences** to open the preferences editor, then choose **Team > Git** to open the EGit plugin preferences.
7. Note the **Default repository folder** setting. This is where your git repositories will be created. 
   You can change the location if the default value isn't acceptable.

-------------------------------
Importing OpenIoT Respository
-------------------------------
All of the core OpenIoT Java code is kept in a single GitHub repository. Previously, each module had its
own repository, but they have since been combined. 

Get Project from GitHub
-----------------------
The next step is to import the OpenIoT source code into your Eclipse development environment. The
following steps will create a local copy of the OpenIoT repository for you:

1. Click **File > Import...** in the Eclipse menu.
2. Choose **Git > Projects from Git** then click Next.
3. Choose **GitHub** as the repository source.
4. Type **openiot** in the search box and click Search.
5. Choose **openiot/openiot** from the list, then keep clicking **Next** until the
   end of the wizard and click **Finish**.
    
Once the repository has been loaded into Eclipse, it will automatically be compiled. The compilation will 
result in errors due to missing library dependencies. In order to load the required libraries onto your local 
machine, you will need to install Apache Maven.
 
--------------------------------------
Installing Maven and Building Projects
--------------------------------------
In order to build the various projects and generate the deployable artifacts, you will need to 
install and run `Apache Maven <http://maven.apache.org/>`_. Version 3.0.5 was used for testing but any Maven 3 version 
should work as well. Download Maven and install as per the instructions, then open a command prompt. Type the following:

.. code-block:: none

	mvn clean install
	
The Maven build will clean any existing build artifacts, download all of the dependencies, and compile all
of the projects individually. The final result from the build process is a web archive (WAR) file in the 
**deploy** directory that can be deployed in OpenIoT server.

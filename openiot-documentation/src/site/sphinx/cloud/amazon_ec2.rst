Running OpenIoT on Amazon EC2
-------------------------------
Amazon's `Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) <http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/>`_ provides an environnment for running virtual
servers in the cloud. Server images are offered in the form on **Amazon Machine Instances (AMIs)** which capture
the state of a configured server so it can be started in the cloud as a virtual machine.

Signing up for AWS/EC2
----------------------
If you do not already have an Amazon AWS account, you will need to create one in order to launch VMs in the cloud.
Amazon virtual machines are not free, but they are also not very expensive if you don't leave them running 
continuously. To create an account, navigate to:

	http://aws.amazon.com/
	
and create a new account. Make sure that your account allows access to EC2. Once you have signed up for an account
you should be able to navigate to:

	https://console.aws.amazon.com
	
to open your AWS console. Click on the **EC2** link and the EC2 dashboard should open. It will look something like the
image below:

Finding a OpenIoT AMI
-----------------------
Each version of OpenIoT has a separate AMI that includes a fully functional system that is ready to go
on bootup. To start your own instance of OpenIoT on EC2, you will first need to find an AMI for the
version of OpenIoT you want to run. First click on the **Launch Instance** button on the dashboard which
will open a wizard for launching a new EC2 instance based on an AMI. Click on the **Community AMIs** tab
at the left and type **OpenIoT** into the search box and press enter. All public OpenIoT instances
will show up in the list as shown below:

   :align: left

Launching an Instance
---------------------
Click the **Select** button next to the version of OpenIoT you want to run. The wizard will move to the next step
which is to select the **instance type**. Click on the **General Purpose** tab on the left to get a list of instance
types. More powerful instances cost more money, so you will probably want to use an **m1.small** or **m1.medium** 
instance to run your server. Performance will be noticeably better with more powerful instances.

.. note:: Amazon offers a free tier which allows you to run a *Micro* instance for a period of time. While OpenIoT
	will run on a Micro account, it is not advised since the system resources are limited at best (your iPad is probably 
	more powerful).

After choosing the instance type, continue clicking **Next** until you get to the **Configure Security Group** step.
This step sets up the inbound firewall so that you can access the instance externally. We need to add a few extra 
rules so external clients can access HTTP, MQTT, and Hazelcast. There is already a rule for SSH, so we just need to 
open up the following ports:

:Port 80:
	Allows instance to serve HTTP.

:Port 1883:
	Allows standard MQTT clients to connect to the internal HiveMQ instance.
	
:Port 5701:
	Allows Hazelcast clients to connect to subscribe to event topics.
	
:Port 61623:
	Allows web sockets to connect to HiveMQ for MQTT from the browser.
	
You can add each of the rules by clicking on the **Add Rule** button, leaving the dropdown selection as **Custom TCP Rule**,
and entering the port number in the **Port Range** textbox. Choose **Anywhere** from the **Source** dropdown. After entering 
all of the rules, you should have a page that looks like below:

.. note:: Once you have entered the details for a security group, they are saved for reuse. When you start another
	instance you can just choose the group by name rather than entering the ports by hand again.

   :align: left

Now click the **Review and Launch** button, verify the information, and click **Launch** to let Amazon start the
instance in the background. Before launching, the wizard will ask you to select an existing key pair or create a new one. 
Choose to create a new key pair (unless you previously created one), enter a name, then click **Download Key Pair** to 
download the private key to your local machine. This key will be used in logging in to the running instance later. 
Click **Launch Instances** to complete the process. If the launch was successful, you should soon see the instance running
under your instances list in the control panel as shown below:

Working with Your OpenIoT Instance
------------------------------------
You should now have a working OpenIoT instance running! The first thing to do is test to make sure we can access
the instance. Rather than access the instance directly by it's IP address, it is easier to map the IP to a name
in our local computer's hosts file. On unix, you can edit **/etc/hosts** and add an entry for **openiot-aws**
mapped to the public IP address of the instance (the public IP is listed on the screen above if you scroll to the 
right). The process is the same on windows, but the file is located in the **C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc** directory.
After adding the host, you should be able to access the OpenIoT Administrative Console application at:

	http://openiot-aws/openiot/admin/
	
If the page doesn't load, the server is probably not running. Make sure it shows up with an **Instance State** of 
**running** (with a green indicator) in the instances panel. If you are able to access the admin UI, the server
should be ready to go. The admin login page should look similar to the one below:

.. image:: /_static/images/cloud/sw-admin-login.png

Viewing Swagger for REST APIs
-----------------------------
The OpenIoT server comes with `Swagger <https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui>`_ installed to allow you to interact
with the OpenIoT REST services. Enter the following URL:

	http://openiot-aws/openiot/
	
and the Swagger user interface should load in the browser as shown below:

.. image:: /_static/images/cloud/sw-swagger.png

   :align: left

Viewing Documentation
---------------------
Documentation for the version of OpenIoT installed on the cloud instance is available at the root of the server. You
can access it via the following URL:

	http://openiot-aws/

Accessing Solr Instance
-----------------------
The cloud instance contains a recent version of `Solr Cloud <https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/SolrCloud>`_ 
for indexing device events for advanced searching. You can access it via:

	http://openiot-aws/solr/

There is a default **core** set up with the OpenIoT document schema. The OpenIoT server instance is already
configured to send any events it receives to be indexed into Solr automatically.

.. note:: The sample data that was auto-loaded into the instance is not indexed in Solr, so you will start
          with zero documents in the index.
          
You can use the built-in Solr tools to access the OpenIoT core and query the documents produced. In the near future,
OpenIoT will have REST APIs that proxy the Solr queries for you, but for now, you have to do it manually.
	 
Logging in via SSH
------------------
In order to configure your cloud instance beyond the default setup, you will need to log in via SSH. Amazon has
a nice overview of how to do exactly that here:

	http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstances.html
	
The Unix username for logging in to the instance is **admin** and the authentication uses
the public key associated when the instance was launched. If you assigned a pass phrase
when creating the key, your client may ask for the phrase on login.
	
Now that you can connect to your cloud instance, the first thing to do is obtain root access so you can crash it!
To swap to root privileges enter:

.. code-block:: none

	sudo -i
	
You will need to be logged in as root to do things like update configurations and restart OpenIoT.
	 	 
Starting and Stopping OpenIoT
-------------------------------
If you make changes to the OpenIoT configuration files or otherwise have need to restart the OpenIoT server,
you can do so without having to restart the entire cloud instance. From an SSH prompt (with root) type:

.. code-block:: none

	/etc/init.d/openiot start
	
to start the OpenIoT server. To shut it down, type:

.. code-block:: none

	/etc/init.d/openiot stop
	 	 
Viewing the OpenIoT Log File
------------------------------
The OpenIoT log file (Log4j output) can be 'tailed' to the terminal by executing the command:

.. code-block:: none

	tail -f /opt/openiot/logs/catalina.out

Setting Up Hazelcast Public Address
-----------------------------------

.. danger:: If you are using external tools that require Hazelcast (such as Mule), you must make an update to
            the default configuration and restart OpenIoT.
            
By default, the Amazon EC2 instance does not know its public IP address and instead sends its internal address
when Hazelcast clients try to connect. This is a bad thing. To fix the problem, locate the public IP address 
in the EC2 control panel (the same address you have mapped to **openiot-aws** in your hosts file). Open the
Hazelcast configuration for OpenIoT:

.. code-block:: none

	vi /opt/openiot/conf/openiot/hazelcast.xml

In the **network** section, there is a **public-address** entry. Replace the address already there with your public
IP address. Save your changes and restart OpenIoT as explained above. You should now be able to connect via Hazelcast.
